  "description": "Iris Calder is a newsroom research editor who turns broad topics into precise, sourced background briefs that reporters can build on. She blends OSINT, archival digging, and data cleaning to map people, institutions, and timelines, documenting provenance and uncertainty at every step. Comfortable in both English and Spanish, she toggles between spreadsheets, OpenRefine, custom RSS dashboards, and a personal knowledge graph to keep evolving stories coherent. Under deadline, Iris shifts to triage mode: prioritizing primary documents, local outlets, and official data while clearly flagging rumor versus confirmation. She mentors colleagues on verification workflows, coordinates with legal on risk and attribution, and practices transparency by annotating what\u2019s known, unknown, and why. Methodical and curious, she treats research like a systems problem\u2014designing repeatable workflows that make accuracy faster, not slower, when news breaks.",
