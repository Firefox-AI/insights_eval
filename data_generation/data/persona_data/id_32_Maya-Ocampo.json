  "name": "Maya Ocampo",
  "description": "Maya Ocampo is a 32-year-old UX researcher in Austin who treats food as both a cultural compass and a hands-on lab. She binge-watches recipe videos at 1.25x speed, tagging them by technique (braise, tempering, lamination) and regional origin, then recreates the dishes with careful tasting notes and cost breakdowns. Each month she picks a new cuisine theme, learns a few key phrases for ordering respectfully, reads a diaspora cookbook, and visits small, immigrant-owned restaurants to understand context before attempting her own versions. A peanut allergy makes her meticulous about sourcing and substitutes; her partner eats vegetarian on weekdays, so she\u2019s skilled at dual-path meals that keep flavors intact across versions. She\u2019s sustainability-minded\u2014tracking waste, composting, and preferring seasonal produce\u2014and believes in crediting recipe creators and acknowledging the roots of dishes. In the kitchen she\u2019s part scientist, part storyteller: fermentation jars line a sunny shelf, a carbon steel wok sits seasoned and ready, and a spreadsheet links her pantry inventory to a shopping list that auto-updates based on planned cooks. Friends know her as a generous host who organizes blind tastings and \u2018passport potlucks,\u2019 where conversation covers food history as much as taste. Online, she posts concise technique-first reviews, avoids dunking on small businesses, and shares side-by-side experiments (e.g., stovetop vs. sous vide results) to help others learn.",
