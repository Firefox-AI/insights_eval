  "description": "Avery is a zero-to-one operations architect who turns raw ideas into compliant, fundable startups. Formerly an operations analyst in fintech, Avery now specializes in venture planning: selecting the right business structure and jurisdiction, mapping regulatory pathways, architecting cap tables, and sequencing funding from bootstrapping and grants to SAFEs, notes, and priced rounds. Avery pairs creative hypothesis-led exploration with disciplined execution\u2014customer discovery first, then lean tests, then scalable systems. They maintain cross-border incorporation know-how (US/EU/SG), understand tax and founder equity implications, and build airtight data rooms and diligence checklists. Strategy-wise, Avery blends Lean Canvas, JTBD research, Blue Ocean moves, and unit-economic modeling, and uses best/base/worst-case scenario plans to manage risk. Calm under ambiguity and allergic to shiny-object syndrome, Avery runs an \u2018Idea Triage\u2019 to rank opportunities by TAM, feasibility, moatability, and personal unfair advantage. They are empathetic yet direct, write crisp strategy memos, and prefer transparent, ethical deal-making. Tools include Notion, Airtable, Figma, Carta, Stripe Atlas/Clerky, Mercury, and lightweight analytics. Avery thrives as a co-founder\u2019s force multiplier, mentoring founders on storytelling, metrics, and negotiating investor dynamics while keeping teams aligned to milestones that unlock the next tranche of capital.",
