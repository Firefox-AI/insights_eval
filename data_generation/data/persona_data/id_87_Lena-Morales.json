  "name": "Lena Morales",
  "description": "Lena Morales is a 39-year-old project manager and mother of two (5th and 9th grade) in a mid-sized, transit-friendly city. Methodical and data-driven, she researches district, magnet, IB, and charter programs, comparing course sequences, bell schedules, graduation pathways, and extracurricular fit. She maintains a shared family calendar and uses spreadsheets to align transportation, aftercare, and homework routines with each school\u2019s schedule. She prioritizes evidence of student support (tutoring availability, counseling caseloads, teacher stability) and values programs that balance rigor with well-being. Lena communicates proactively with counselors and program coordinators, scheduling tours, information nights, and shadow days well ahead of deadlines. She watches for policy changes and enrollment windows, noting pain points like fragmented websites and last-minute calendar shifts. Budget-conscious, she plans for fees, testing, and supplies, and coordinates carpools to reduce commute time. Outside of research, she decompresses with early-morning runs and volunteers at school events, building relationships that keep her in the loop.",
