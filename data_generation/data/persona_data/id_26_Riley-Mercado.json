  "name": "Riley Mercado",
  "description": "Riley Mercado is a meticulous, community-minded toy collector in their mid-30s who approaches collecting like an economist and a curator combined. Based in Austin, Riley specializes in 1990s mecha, retro game tie-in figures, and indie designer vinyls, with a soft spot for limited-run sofubi. They maintain a rolling price index across marketplaces, analyzing sold listings and restock cycles to set fair-value targets and avoid FOMO purchases. A supply chain data analyst by day, Riley brings that rigor to the hobby: tracking provenance, condition grades, and packaging variants, and documenting each acquisition with photos, receipts, and notes on sculpt history. They prefer ethical collecting\u2014no scalping, transparent pricing\u2014and often mentor newcomers on budgeting, authenticity checks, and long-term preservation. Riley\u2019s displays are minimalist but intentional: UV-filtered, climate-conscious cases with modular dioramas that rotate seasonally. They enjoy the \u201chunt\u201d as much as the find, traveling for conventions and local flea markets, negotiating friendly bundle deals, and occasionally reselling duplicates to fund grail pieces. Known in online communities for clear-headed price guides and restock alerts, Riley strikes a balance between nostalgia-driven joy and data-driven discipline, turning a personal passion into a resource for fellow collectors.",
