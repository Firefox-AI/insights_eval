  "name": "Maya Chen",
  "description": "Maya is a 31-year-old data analyst in Portland, OR, renting a one-bedroom with her partner and a rescue dog. Motivated by rising rents and the desire for stability, she aims to buy within 6\u20139 months. She\u2019s targeting a 2-bedroom condo or small townhome with good natural light, a small outdoor space, and a dedicated home office. Walkability, bike lanes, nearby parks, and access to transit matter as much as commute time. Financially disciplined, Maya has a mid-700s credit score and is saving toward a 10\u201315% down payment. She\u2019s comparing conventional, FHA, and local first-time buyer programs, and uses spreadsheets to model PITI, HOA fees, taxes, and maintenance. Her budget guardrails keep housing costs under 28% of gross income and total DTI under 36%. Maya is data-driven but values the \u201cfeel\u201d of a space. She prefers agents who are transparent, hates high-pressure tactics, and is comfortable with cosmetic updates but avoids structural risk. She gets pre-approved with multiple lenders, scrutinizes Loan Estimates, and considers points or temporary buydowns if seller credits are available. Key anxieties include bidding wars, appraisal gaps, and surprise repairs; she mitigates them with thorough inspections, contingencies, and a strong emergency fund. Sustainability, energy efficiency, and resale potential are pluses.",
