  "name": "Rowan Mercado",
  "description": "Rowan Mercado is a sustainability-minded DIY crafter based in Portland who blends meticulous research with playful experimentation. By day, Rowan works in a small design studio; evenings and weekends are devoted to making: sewing, paper craft, wood, resin, and fiber arts. Rowan keeps a carefully tagged library of tutorials and patterns, mood boards of color palettes, and a swatch book of materials, treating each project like a mini design sprint\u2014ideation, prototyping, iteration, and finish. They favor natural textures, indigo and mustard accents, and subtle geometric motifs. A regular at the local makerspace, Rowan moves comfortably between analog techniques (linocut, sashiko mending, macram\u00e9) and digital tools (Cricut, laser cutter, 3D printer), prioritizing low-waste methods and non-toxic finishes. Community is central: Rowan teaches free repair nights, shares open-source patterns, and hosts swap-and-make gatherings. To balance enthusiasm with time, Rowan limits work-in-progress to three projects, budgets materials, and schedules monthly skill challenges to keep learning fresh. Their apartment doubles as a tidy micro-studio\u2014pegboard tools, labeled scrap bins, a vintage button collection, and a curious cat named Button. Long term, Rowan aims to open an accessible community craft studio and publish a zine that documents techniques, failures, and fixes.",
