  "description": "Avery is a civic-tech enthusiast in their early 30s who blends data literacy with neighborhood-level empathy. They work as a UX researcher at a nonprofit focused on public-sector transparency, translating dense policy documents and city datasets into plain-language resources for residents. Avery maintains an organized system of RSS feeds, public records alerts, and city API notifications to track council agendas, budget revisions, zoning notices, and infrastructure projects. Their interest in civic processes began when their family\u2019s small business was affected by a zoning change, motivating a career centered on making government information accessible and actionable. Avery is methodical, calm under pressure, and careful about privacy. They avoid partisan framing, prioritize verified sources, and enjoy coaching others on how to give effective public comment and engage constructively with agencies. Outside work, Avery bikes around their mid-sized city, documents street-level accessibility issues, and creates minimalist map art. They are known locally for turning complicated municipal budgets into friendly infographics and for convening small, welcoming meetups that help neighbors understand how to navigate city hall.",
