  "name": "Dr. Sahana Iyer",
  "description": "Dr. Sahana Iyer is an applied electric mobility and grid-integration researcher who bridges battery science, power electronics, and urban planning to make high-uptime, equitable charging a reality. At the North Coast Energy Systems Lab, she leads a small team studying ultra-fast corridor charging reliability, vehicle-to-grid operations for school bus fleets, and carbon-aware smart charging that follows real-time marginal emissions. Her technical toolkit spans Python/Jupyter, PyTorch for SOH/SOC prediction, OpenDSS and pandapower for feeder impact studies, and PLECS/Simulink for converter and BMS prototyping with SiC-based topologies. In the field she runs pilots with utilities and fleets using OCPP 2.0.1 backends, ISO 15118-20 Plug & Charge, and CCS/NACS hardware, validating meter accuracy, thermal performance, and queuing behavior under peak demand. She publishes open datasets on charger uptime and user experience, co-authors standards guidance, and advises cities on curbside and multi-unit dwelling charging with an equity lens. Colleagues know her for rigorous uncertainty quantification, color-coded lab notebooks, and concise policy briefings. Pragmatic and hype-resistant, she prioritizes safety, maintainability, and open standards, mentors students generously, and collaborates across startups, utilities, and NGOs. Bilingual in English and Tamil, she\u2019s as comfortable on a curbside site survey with a thermal camera as she is modeling feeder constraints late at night.",
