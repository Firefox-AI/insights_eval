  "name": "Avery Kwan",
  "description": "Avery Kwan is a 29-year-old UX researcher in Seattle who treats interiors as an iterative, research-driven hobby. As an Interior Inspiration Viewer, Avery consumes and catalogs design imagery daily and deliberately revisits saved ideas until a concept feels tested enough to try. Renting a light-filled one-bedroom with a partner and a cat, Avery blends warm Scandinavian and Japandi influences with select vintage pieces, favoring calm textures, natural light, and plant-friendly layouts. Constraints\u2014rental rules, a careful budget, and limited storage\u2014shape a focus on reversible upgrades, secondhand sourcing, and sustainable materials. Avery builds layered mood boards, tags saves by room, palette, and constraints, simulates with AR, and validates choices against a measured floor plan before purchasing. Most changes start as low-risk trials (art rotation, textiles, shelf styling) evaluated via photographs and checklists; only proven ideas graduate to bigger pieces. Platforms like Pinterest, Instagram Saves, and Houzz feed inspiration; Morpholio Board/Milanote organize concepts; a Notion \"Home Lab\" links images to actionable steps; IKEA Place and MagicPlan preview scale; Facebook Marketplace and eBay source pieces. Avery\u2019s satisfaction comes from the loop of discovery, curation, and revisiting\u2014purchases are slow and intentional, and the home evolves seasonally through lighting, textiles, and scent to support calm, cozy living.",

    "Schedules a weekly \"moodboard hour\" to cull, tag, and reprioritize saved interiors.",
    "Maintains Pinterest boards per room and vibe with tags like \"renter-friendly,\" \"cat-proof,\" and \"under $200.\"",
    "Uses AR apps (IKEA Place, Morpholio) to test rug sizes, art scale, and sofa depth before buying.",
    "Photographs room vignettes from consistent angles to compare iterations over time.",
    "Rotates textiles and art seasonally to trial saved styling ideas without major purchases.",
    "Keeps a swatch library of fabrics, paints, and finishes in labeled envelopes and a binder.",
    "Visits thrift stores and estate sales, measuring potential finds and checking them against boards.",
    "Sets price-drop alerts and maintains a \"dupe list\" of budget-friendly alternatives.",
    "Shares mood boards with partner/friends for asynchronous feedback and tie-breakers.",
    "Runs a monthly \"layout lab\" moving furniture slightly to optimize flow, sightlines, and light.",
    "Tracks small-space hacks (hidden storage, foldable pieces) and pilots one each quarter.",
    "Uses Notion to turn saved images into micro-tasks (e.g., \"replace entry rug\") with due dates.",
    "Experiments with layered lighting scenes and scent to align the space with chosen palettes and moods.",
    "Participates in r/InteriorDesign and local buy-nothing groups to swap decor and ideas.",
    "Visits open houses to study staging, note lighting strategies, and gather photo references."
