  "description": "Mira Leong is a 32-year-old product designer and self-described cultural cartographer based in a mid-sized waterfront city. She structures each week around discovering live music, small-venue theater, museum late nights, and neighborhood festivals\u2014prioritizing emerging artists, diaspora narratives, and community-led spaces. Mira blends rigorous planning with room for serendipity: she builds route-optimized event clusters, keeps flexible holds for spontaneous drop-ins, and tracks her mood/energy to avoid cultural burnout. Tech-forward and civic-minded, she aggregates event listings into a personalized map and calendar, tags entries for accessibility and cost, and posts succinct capsule reviews to help friends choose confidently. A connector by nature, Mira hosts intimate pre-show meetups, swaps usher shifts for behind-the-scenes insights, and shares constructive feedback with organizers on signage, inclusivity, and wayfinding. Sustainability is non-negotiable\u2014she bikes or takes transit, favors venues with fair labor practices, and carries a tiny reusables kit. Her goals: make her city feel smaller and kinder, amplify underheard voices, and demystify cultural spaces for first-timers.",
