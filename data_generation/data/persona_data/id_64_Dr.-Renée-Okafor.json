  "description": "Dr. Ren\u00e9e Okafor is a mid-career academic researcher who leads the Open Cognition Lab, where she studies how memory consolidates over time and how research practices influence the credibility of findings. She blends bench neuroscience with meta-research, often reanalyzing classic datasets and revisiting decades of journal issues to trace how ideas evolve. A meticulous organizer, she keeps a living, annotated library in Zotero and Obsidian, maintaining topic maps that link papers, code, and preregistrations. Her methodological toolkit spans Bayesian hierarchical models, mixed-effects designs, and careful power analyses, and she is a vocal advocate of registered reports, open data, and reproducible workflows on GitHub. Ren\u00e9e mentors with a \u201cskills-first\u201d philosophy\u2014weekly code clinics, preprint dry-runs, and paper-writing sprints\u2014while fostering psychological safety so students can share failed attempts without stigma. She sits on the editorial board of a reproducibility-focused journal, writes exacting but constructive peer reviews, and routinely organizes cross-field reading groups to reduce siloed thinking. Known for her calm focus and color-coded planning, she guards deep-work blocks for writing, then uses late evenings for literature sweeps to revisit journals and update her evidence maps. Outside grant cycles, she pilots small, rigorous replications and maintains a public checklist that turns common research red flags into actionable fixes. Curious, principled, and quietly playful, Ren\u00e9e treats scholarship as a long conversation\u2014one she keeps alive by continuously returning to the literature with fresh questions and better tools.",
  "example_behaviours": [
    "Runs weekly \u2018Journal Revisit\u2019 sessions where she rereads older issues of key journals to update citation networks and annotate shifts in terminology.",
    "Maintains a Zotero library with custom tags (e.g., \u201creplication-candidate,\u201d \u201cmethod-innovation,\u201d \u201ceffect-size-uncertain\u201d) and syncs notes to Obsidian graph views.",
    "Hosts a monthly open lab \u2018Reproduction Night,\u2019 rebuilding published analyses from scratch and documenting every step in a public GitHub repository.",
    "Uses a Friday afternoon \u2018failure log\u2019 to record hypotheses that didn\u2019t pan out and the lessons learned, shared with her team to normalize null results.",
    "Collects vintage fountain pens and uses different inks to color-code marginalia: blue for methods, green for limitations, red for future work.",
    "Urban birdwatching at dawn while listening to long-form interviews; logs sightings and ideas that surface during the walk.",
    "Bakes sourdough early on grant-deadline mornings as a ritual to manage stress and set a focus cadence for the day.",
    "Builds small open-source tools (e.g., a Zotero-to-preregistration helper script) and writes concise tutorials for junior researchers.",
    "Runs \u2018cross-pollination\u2019 reading groups that pair unrelated papers (e.g., a classic cognitive model with a modern machine learning interpretability study) to spark new research angles."
