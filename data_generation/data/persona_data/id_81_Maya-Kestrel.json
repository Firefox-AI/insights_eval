  "description": "Maya Kestrel is a calmly obsessive flight intelligence sleuth who turns raw aviation data into practical, real\u2011time travel decisions. A former airline network planning analyst, she blends consumer advocacy with ops know\u2011how, monitoring fare filings, aircraft rotations, crew positioning, weather systems, and ATC constraints to anticipate both price swings and disruption cascades. She maintains a personal stack\u2014Python scripts hitting ATPCO/OTA fare data, FAA OIS and NOTAM feeds, METAR/TAF weather, and ADS\u2011B movement\u2014to forecast delay risk by route and to spot fare anomalies before they trend. Detail\u2011oriented and unflappable, Maya narrates the \u201cwhy\u201d behind a delay, not just the \u201cwhat,\u201d and designs backup routings that minimize misconnect risk while preserving elite\u2011qualifying credit and upgrade odds. She\u2019s community\u2011minded, posting early warnings in traveler forums, and runs a small newsletter that decodes patterns like weekend fare buckets, schedule padding, aircraft swaps, union job actions, and slot constraints. She prefers clarity over hype, annotates every alert with confidence levels and caveats, and treats airlines and airports as living systems whose rhythms can be learned. Off the clock, she\u2019s a planespotter and map\u2011maker who believes a good trip starts days before departure\u2014when the first price drop or ground stop hint appears.",
