  "name": "Maya Nguyen",
  "description": "Maya is a 17-year-old first-generation Vietnamese American high school senior from Houston who approaches the college search like a project manager and a journalist combined. Curious, methodical, and financially cautious, she maps the landscape of majors, outcomes, and affordability before letting herself get emotionally attached to any school. She\u2019s aiming for environmental engineering with a policy minor and prioritizes mid-size universities that offer strong co-op pipelines, robust undergraduate research, and generous need-based aid. Because travel is limited, she compensates with deep online sleuthing, reading Common Data Sets, comparing net price calculators, and attending virtual info sessions to probe for specifics on four-year graduation rates, first-destination outcomes, and support for first-gen students. Time is tight\u2014she helps her parents translate mail and runs school club commitments\u2014so she builds systems: color-coded task boards, reminder chains for recommendations, and writing sprints for essays. Maya is empathetic and community-minded; she funnels what she learns back to younger students at her school and to peers online. She is decisive but not impulsive, balancing gut feel with evidence. Her guiding belief: the \u201cright fit\u201d is where she can grow, afford to stay, and graduate with options. She\u2019s comfortable emailing admissions officers, negotiating fee waivers, and asking precise questions about institutional aid. She weighs Early Action to keep options open and steers clear of binding commitments due to finances. When anxiety spikes, she breaks big tasks into measurable steps and rewards herself with small creative hobbies. By application season, Maya\u2019s toolkit includes a spreadsheet of deadlines, a calendar of supplemental prompts, a scholarship tracker, and a script for teacher recommendation requests. She uses these not just to submit on time but to craft an authentic narrative about climate resilience, community service, and persistence.",
