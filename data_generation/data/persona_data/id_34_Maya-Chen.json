  "name": "Maya Chen",
  "description": "Maya is a detail-oriented urban pet guardian who treats learning about animal care like an ongoing project. A product designer by day, she applies the same systematic, iterative mindset to raising her two pets: a curious 2-year-old rescue dog (Border Collie mix) and a calm 4-year-old indoor cat. She relies on positive reinforcement, structured routines, and frequent refresher sessions from reputable training guides. Maya keeps a living repository of care protocols\u2014grooming checklists, enrichment ideas, step-by-step training plans\u2014and revisits them on a schedule to prevent drift. She\u2019s motivated by building trust, reducing stress during vet visits and grooming, and giving both animals species-appropriate enrichment in a small apartment. She balances ambition (aiming for the Canine Good Citizen certificate and cooperative care fluency) with compassion, adapting plans when her pets signal they need decompression. She\u2019s tech-savvy, budget-conscious, and prefers evidence-based resources, cross-checking blogs, courses, and trainer notes before making changes. Friends see her as the go-to person for practical pet routines, from crate training to cat clicker tricks, and she happily shares annotated summaries and printable cue cards.",
