  "name": "Riley Nguyen",
  "description": "Riley is a 29-year-old remote UX designer who\u2019s new to structured fitness after years of on-and-off activity. They\u2019re motivated by improving energy, posture, and confidence rather than chasing extreme physique goals. Riley has a small apartment setup (yoga mat, resistance bands, adjustable dumbbells) and a nearby park with a gentle loop for walks. A mild, intermittent knee ache makes them cautious about high-impact moves and squats, so they prioritize learning correct form, building joint stability, and progressing gradually. They\u2019re data-curious but not obsessive: they track steps, sleep, and a few simple workout metrics to see trends and celebrate consistency. Riley learns best through short tutorials and clear visual cues, appreciates routine and habit stacking, and prefers approachable, evidence-informed guidance. Time-wise, midday movement breaks and early-evening sessions fit best, with weekends reserved for longer walks or trying a beginner class. Nutrition-wise, Riley is experimenting with balanced plates and simple meal prep, aiming to support workouts without rigid rules; they enjoy cooking familiar comfort foods with lighter tweaks. Socially, they\u2019re a bit gym-shy but like friendly accountability\u2014pairing with a coworker for step challenges and joining beginner-friendly communities. Their biggest hurdles are perfectionism and all-or-nothing thinking; they respond well to micro-goals, gentle progressions, and cues that reduce overwhelm (e.g., \u201cfive good reps\u201d over \u201cuntil failure\u201d). Long-term, Riley wants to comfortably run a 5K, perform a solid push-up set with good form, and feel mentally refreshed by movement, not drained.",
