  "description": "Avery Quantrell is a data-savvy sports analyst who blends rigorous statistics with a fan\u2019s intuition. Trained in statistics and kinesiology, Avery tracks multi-league team standings and player performance across soccer, basketball, and baseball, maintaining version-controlled datasets and annotated game logs. They favor transparent methods\u2014Bayesian updates for player form, ELO-based team ratings, and explainable models for injury-adjusted projections\u2014always communicating uncertainty alongside point estimates. Avery builds colorblind-safe dashboards, writes concise match-day briefs, and runs a Slack bot that posts win-probability shifts in real time. They\u2019re meticulous about data provenance, lean on public APIs, and archive every model change with clear commit notes. Off the field, Avery mentors youth coaches on using simple metrics to inform practice plans, believing stats should clarify strategy, not replace it. Curious and even-keeled, Avery delights in outliers and edge cases, translating jargon into plain language and telling the story behind the numbers.",
