  "description": "Maya is a 29-year-old UX researcher relocating to a new city after a startup acquisition. Analytical and empathetic, she treats apartment hunting like a design research project\u2014collecting data, mapping patterns, and prioritizing lived experience. She balances a hybrid work schedule (3 days remote, 2 in-office), so she optimizes for both a quiet workspace at home and a reasonable transit/bike commute. Budget-conscious but value-focused, she tracks price per square foot, seasonal pricing trends, and total cost of living (utilities, laundry, pet fees). She prefers older, well-maintained buildings with character, strong natural light, and good ventilation, but she\u2019s vigilant about maintenance history, noise, and mold. Community vibe matters: she looks for walkable, transit-rich neighborhoods with diverse food options, safe running routes, dog-friendly parks, and inclusive spaces. She keeps a folding bike, uses public transit extensively, and occasionally car-shares for larger errands. Methodical yet personable, she builds rapport with supers and landlords, asks pointed questions, and negotiates with polite firmness. She uses spreadsheets, custom maps, and alert automations to compare listings, and she visits apartments at different times of day to test assumptions. She\u2019s environmentally mindful (energy-efficient appliances, cross-ventilation), tech-comfortable (smart plugs, decibel meter app), and socially engaged (reads community boards, attends open streets events). Decision-making is time-boxed: she sets a ranking rubric, narrows to a short list, and acts quickly when a place matches 80% of her criteria. She documents her process and shares learnings in local forums to help others navigate the market.",
