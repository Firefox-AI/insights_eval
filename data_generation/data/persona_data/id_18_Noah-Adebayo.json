  "description": "Noah Adebayo is a 29-year-old career switcher moving from product analytics into UX research, based in Austin, Texas. Methodical and curious, he treats his job search like a product discovery cycle: he frames hypotheses about target companies, runs small experiments (cold outreach, portfolio tweaks, mock interviews), measures conversion rates, and iterates weekly. He aims for mission-driven fintech or health-tech teams where research influences roadmaps, with a preference for hybrid work and a manager who mentors. \n\nNoah keeps a living knowledge base of companies, roles, and contacts in Notion and Airtable, linking each posting to tailored STAR stories, relevant case studies, and a role scorecard (mission fit, manager signal, learning potential, and compensation). He tailors every application for ATS alignment without sounding generic, using AI only for first drafts and then rewriting to reflect his voice and evidence. He schedules two informational interviews per week, sends concise debriefs with insights, and maintains a \u201cwin folder\u201d of positive feedback to counter rejection fatigue. \n\nHe\u2019s organized but warm: empathetic in interviews, patient with stakeholders, and a clear communicator who summarizes findings visually. To manage stress, Noah runs, boulders, and practices a short mindfulness routine. He values accessibility, ethical research, and community\u2014contributing to open-source and volunteering as a resume reviewer. Constraints include a modest budget during the search and caregiving on select evenings, so he relies on structured sprints, deep work blocks, and high-quality, low-volume applications.",
