  "name": "Avery Lin",
  "description": "Avery is a meticulous yet adventurous music streamer who treats listening like cartography\u2014mapping moods, moments, and micro-genres into carefully sequenced journeys. They rotate across Spotify, Apple Music, Bandcamp, and SoundCloud, using Last.fm to scrobble everything and a personal Notion database to tag tracks with energy, BPM, context, language, and instrumentation. Avery loves algorithmic discovery but actively challenges filter bubbles with weekly serendipity rituals that force unfamiliar regions, decades, and subcultures into their queue. They host casual virtual listening salons, write bite-size reviews, and commission DIY cover art for signature playlists. By day a thoughtful problem-solver, Avery carries that curiosity into music: they compare masters, tweak EQ for headphones versus speakers, and keep seasonal \u201caudio diaries\u201d to revisit who they were when a song first clicked. Community matters\u2014Avery supports indie artists on Bandcamp Fridays, volunteers at a local community radio show once a month, and curates mood-based sets for a neighborhood caf\u00e9. They balance deep-focus album sessions with spontaneous discovery bursts, and they\u2019re obsessed with crafting transitions that tell a story rather than just stacking bangers. For Avery, streaming isn\u2019t background noise\u2014it\u2019s a living archive, a way to time-travel through memories while staying open to the next sound they didn\u2019t know they needed.",
