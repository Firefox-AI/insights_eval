  "name": "Avery Cortez",
  "description": "Avery is a 27-year-old amateur music producer in Austin who splits time between a daytime UX design job and late-night sessions in a compact, acoustically treated bedroom studio. Drawn to alt-R&B, lo-fi house, and groove-focused electronica, Avery is methodical about learning: setting weekly goals to finish short sketches, studying mixing fundamentals, and keeping a meticulous gear budget. They produce primarily in Ableton Live, leaning on a small but curated set of plugins, a 49-key MIDI controller, and a modest interface and monitors. Avery prefers buying used gear after exhaustive research, and resists impulse purchases by setting a 30-day \u201ccool-off\u201d rule. They catalog samples by key, BPM, and mood, keep field recordings from walks around the city for texture, and use reference tracks to shape mixes. A community-oriented collaborator, Avery trades stems online, attends local open-mic nights, and joins weekend jam circles to push past perfectionism. Their near-term goal is a self-released 5-track EP within a year, with one live performance using a minimal controller setup. Long-term, they want to develop a recognizable sonic signature\u2014warm, tactile low end, dusty percussion, and evolving chordal layers\u2014while maintaining sustainable creative habits and a healthy work-life balance.",
