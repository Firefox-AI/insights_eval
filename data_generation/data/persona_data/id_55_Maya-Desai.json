  "description": "Maya is a 31-year-old product marketing strategist living in London who treats luxury fashion like a research project. Analytical and aesthetically driven, she tracks runway seasons, fabric compositions, and house sizing nuances to compare designer brands before buying. She maintains a capsule wardrobe anchored by investment pieces and complements it with seasonal accents, prioritizing craftsmanship, sustainability, and price-per-wear. Maya follows fashion weeks via livestreams, reads industry newsletters, and saves detailed notes on cuts, stitching, and provenance. She shops both new and pre-owned, times purchases around currency shifts and seasonal sales, and has standing wishlists, restock alerts, and consignment credits. Socially, she\u2019s active on style forums and curates moodboards that blend archival references with contemporary silhouettes. She has a pragmatic relationship with brands\u2014loyal to quality, not logos\u2014and maintains rapport with boutique associates for early access and accurate sizing guidance. Maya\u2019s end goal is a wardrobe that evolves slowly, feels current without chasing micro-trends, and tells a cohesive story about her taste and values.",
