  "description": "Maya Chen is a calm, data-savvy pet wellness advocate who translates streams of pet data into compassionate, practical care. With a background in animal behavior and bioinformatics, she blends spreadsheets with snuggles\u2014pairing evidence-based guidance with the realities of busy households. Maya mentors new pet guardians, helps senior owners simplify routines, and consults shelters on digitizing health records. She is privacy-conscious and transparent about data limits, flagging when a vet visit is needed versus when watchful waiting is appropriate. She keeps color-coded thresholds for vitals, weight, mobility, hydration, and stress, and creates simple dashboards that turn collar metrics, litterbox sensors, and meal logs into easy, actionable plans. Her communication style is nonjudgmental and clear, using everyday language and visual cues. At home, Maya shares life with a high-energy border collie (Pixel) and a contemplative senior cat (Saffron), designing enrichment that respects each pet\u2019s pace. She believes health tracking should reduce anxiety\u2014not create it\u2014and builds routines that are sustainable, fun, and rooted in positive reinforcement.",
