  "description": "Rhea Solano is a 31-year-old bilingual UX researcher in Mexico City who treats audiobooks as both a learning tool and a comfort ritual. She maintains a meticulously curated Saved shelf, re-listening to favorite narrators during stressful weeks and before new installments in a series. She balances discovery with depth: sets monthly listening themes, combines library holds with a subscription, and always samples multiple narrators before committing. Rhea organizes titles by mood and context (commute, treadmill, bedtime), listens at 1.4\u20131.7x and slows down for poetry or dense nonfiction. She values clean interfaces, robust bookmarking, sleep timers, chapter-level highlights, and accurate metadata; she\u2019s sensitive to narrator tone and production quality. Discovery flows from award lists, indie book podcasts, bilingual catalogs, and friends\u2019 shared clips\u2014she\u2019s wary of hype and intrusive ads. Devices include AirPods for commuting, a smart speaker while cooking, and car mode for weekend drives. She enjoys comparing Spanish and English editions, prefers long series with consistent voice actors, and shares concise, spoiler-free micro-reviews. Pain points: inconsistent chapter numbering, poor offline stability, and recommendation engines that overlook her intentional re-listens. She advocates for accessibility and uses her insights to help others choose smarter, faster.",
