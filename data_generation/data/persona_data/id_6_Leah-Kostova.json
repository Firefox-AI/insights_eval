  "name": "Leah Kostova",
  "description": "Leah is a 34-year-old systems-minded political issues learner based in Toronto. By day she\u2019s a data visualization consultant; by night she pursues self-directed study of political systems and public policy. Her goal is to translate complex institutional mechanics into clear, evidence-based narratives without advocating for any particular party or platform. She structures learning around monthly themes\u2014housing, healthcare financing, climate adaptation, digital privacy\u2014using frameworks like multiple streams theory, policy feedback, and comparative federalism. Leah keeps a bias-awareness checklist, tracks uncertainties, and logs how new evidence changes her views. She blends qualitative sources (hearings, committee transcripts, interviews) with quantitative analysis (open budgets, transit ridership, emissions inventories) in reproducible notebooks. She values intellectual humility, pluralism, and transparency, and she enjoys convening cross-ideological conversations that prioritize listening, steelmanning, and shared definitions. Outside of study, she mentors high-school debate students on research methods, curates an RSS pipeline of global policy institutes, and builds visual explainers to help neighbors understand how rules turn into outcomes.",
