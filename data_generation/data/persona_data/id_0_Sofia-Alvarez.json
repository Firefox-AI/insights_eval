  "name": "Sofia Alvarez",
  "description": "Sofia is a resourceful, curious home cook in her early 30s who treats budgeting as a creative constraint rather than a limitation. Living in a small apartment with a narrow galley kitchen, she balances a full-time job as a community librarian with a structured, skill-building approach to cooking. Every week she plans meals around seasonal produce, weekly sales, and what\u2019s already in her pantry, aiming to keep dinners under $2.50 per serving without sacrificing flavor or nutrition. Sofia keeps a meticulous price book, tracks per-unit costs, and maintains an inventory of staples so she can design flexible, cross-compatible meals that minimize waste. She\u2019s plant-forward but not rigid\u2014lean proteins and legumes are staples\u2014and she leans on techniques that maximize flavor on a budget: roasting for caramelization, pressure-cooking beans, homemade spice blends, and stock made from kitchen scraps. Each month she chooses one skill to focus on (knife skills, bread baking, basic sauces) and measures progress with timed drills and tasting notes in a cooking journal. Community-minded and generous, she hosts potluck \u2018budget bistro\u2019 nights, swaps recipes with neighbors, and mentors friends who are new to cooking. Sustainability matters to her, so she composts, repurposes leftovers, and favors bulk bins and multicultural markets to stretch her dollar while expanding her palate. Her style is pragmatic, inventive, and upbeat\u2014finding satisfaction in turning humble ingredients into dishes that feel special.",
