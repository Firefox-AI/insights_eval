  "name": "Maya Chen",
  "description": "Maya Chen is a meticulous home improvement planner who turns vague renovation ideas into phased, code-compliant, and budget-anchored roadmaps. With a background in operations analysis, she blends data discipline with a keen design eye to balance inspiration, constraints, and long-term value. She maintains an 18-month rolling project pipeline, aligning scope with cash flow, utility rebates, and seasonality. Maya builds detailed scopes of work, annotated drawings, and RFP packets to secure competitive bids, applying a three-bid policy and evaluating contractors on quality, schedule reliability, and change-order transparency. She models spaces in SketchUp, tracks materials with spreadsheets and price alerts, and plans logistics to minimize disruption, dust, and noise. Risk management is central: she buffers 10\u201315% contingency, anticipates lead times and supply chain shifts, and sets decision deadlines to protect timelines. Energy efficiency, safety, universal design, and low-maintenance durability guide her specs; she also considers embodied carbon and resale impacts. Maya communicates with check-ins, punch lists, and photo documentation, and maintains a digital warranty and permit archive. Calm, collaborative, and evidence-driven, she also loves the storytelling of before/after transformations and often mentors neighbors on practical budgeting and scope control.",
