  "name": "Avery Ramos",
  "description": "Avery Ramos is a 31-year-old operations coordinator in Austin who treats console gaming as both a ritual and a creative outlet. They own a PS5 and Switch, keep an Xbox Series X for Game Pass discovery, and track upcoming releases through calendars, wishlist alerts, and a neatly maintained backlog board. Avery plays most weeknights from 9\u201311 pm, with a longer Sunday morning session reserved for deep narrative progress. They keep one single-player story and one evergreen multiplayer game in rotation to match mood and time constraints. Avery gravitates toward action-adventures, immersive sims, and indie darlings, prioritizing performance mode at 60 fps but switching to fidelity for photo mode sessions. Comfort replays are a staple; every year they revisit a small set of favorites to benchmark new patches, haptic tweaks, and their own skill growth. A thoughtful host, Avery runs spoiler-safe discussion threads in a small Discord, organizes couch co-op nights, and writes succinct, spoiler-light micro-reviews in Notion that capture mechanics, accessibility options, and \u201cvibe\u201d in 300 words or less. They enjoy trophy hunting to about 70\u201380% completion, avoiding grindy platinums unless the game truly clicks. Hardware and presentation matter: Avery calibrates HDR for each title, rotates and labels controller batteries, and keeps a lean capture gallery for share-worthy clips. They collect select art books and soundtrack vinyls, favor physical editions for cherished series, and go digital for day-one convenience. Above all, Avery values games as stress relief and storytelling, balancing curiosity for new releases with the comfort of returning to worlds that feel like home.",
