  "name": "Maya Chen",
  "description": "Maya is a curious, detail-oriented urban professional who unwinds by falling down well-curated rabbit holes of cooking videos. She treats YouTube and short-form food content like culinary school in bite-size lessons\u2014favoring creators who explain technique, equipment choices, and the why behind steps. Her viewing ranges from ASMR knife-work and minimalist Japanese bento prep to long-form deep dives on food science, fermentation, and regional street foods. She keeps a living database of recipes and methods, tags them by cuisine, difficulty, and primary technique, and tracks substitutions for budget and dietary flexibility. On weeknights she applies speed-friendly hacks (air fryer, pressure cooker, batch sauces), while weekends become playful experiments where she reproduces dishes from travel vlogs or attempts a chef\u2019s signature plate. Maya cares about sustainability and frugality: she plans meals from what\u2019s already in the pantry, practices nose-to-tail/leaf-to-stem cooking, and prioritizes seasonal produce. She\u2019s social but not showy\u2014hosting small potlucks where each dish must come from a video and its link is shared with tasting notes. For her, cooking videos are equal parts relaxation, learning, and cultural connection, and she delights in the small wins\u2014crisper scallion pancakes, shinier emulsions, quieter knife taps\u2014earned from attentive watching and mindful practice.",
  "example_behaviours": [
    "Curates playlists by technique (e.g., emulsions, stir-fry wok hei, lamination) and revisits them at 1.25x speed with captions on",
    "Maintains a Notion board linking videos to personal tasting notes, substitution ideas, and timing estimates for her own kitchen",
    "Runs small A/B tests from video tips\u2014like comparing brining lengths or oil smoke points\u2014and records outcomes",
    "Replicates a street-food recipe each Saturday, budgeting to source one new spice or pantry staple from an international market",
    "Hosts a monthly \u2018video-to-plate\u2019 potluck where friends bring a dish and the original link, then they vote on best fidelity and best twist",
    "Uses leftover-mapping: watches fridge-forage videos, then designs a three-meal plan to clear produce before it spoils",
    "Practices plating by pausing videos at finishing steps and mimicking garnish placement and sauce swipes",
    "Experiments with fermentation after watching deep-dive series (quick pickles on weeknights; longer projects like kimchi or sourdough on holidays)",
    "Leaves time-stamped comments on creators\u2019 pages noting alternative tools (e.g., microplane vs. zester) and home-kitchen adjustments",
    "Runs a quarterly \u2018pantry audit\u2019 inspired by minimal-waste channels, labeling jars and logging dates to reduce food waste",
    "Uses a shared family playlist to collect approachable recipes for relatives with dietary needs, adding her tested substitutions",
    "Pairs cooking video sessions with low-stress chores (knife sharpening, spice blending) as a calming ritual after work"
