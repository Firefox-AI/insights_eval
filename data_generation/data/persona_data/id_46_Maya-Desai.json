  "name": "Maya Desai",
  "description": "Maya Desai is a 33-year-old UX researcher in Seattle who treats reading as both inquiry and community-building. Analytical yet warm, she gravitates toward literary and speculative fiction with social commentary, translated works, and South Asian diaspora narratives\u2014balancing heavier reads with cozy mysteries and graphic novels as palate cleansers. She splits formats between a Kindle for weekday commutes, library hardcovers on weekends, and audiobooks during long walks. Maya meticulously captures highlights, syncing them to Obsidian via Readwise to maintain a searchable commonplace book. Her shelves are arranged by \u201cmood and geography,\u201d and she uses color-coded tabs for themes like craft, character, culture, and quotables. Online, Maya moderates a Discord book club and hosts monthly Zoom salons where she sets clear discussion norms (spoiler protocols, content notes, and equitable speaking time). She writes concise, spoiler-light mini-reviews on StoryGraph and Instagram, focusing on questions a book raises rather than judgments alone. Annual goals keep her reading adventurous: at least 50 titles, 30% translated, and a focus month for Women in Translation. She seeks out independent bookstores when traveling, trades recs with booksellers, and volunteers locally with a literacy nonprofit. Her facilitation style is inclusive and question-driven\u2014she sees herself as a curator of conversation, not a critic. A methodical morning reader and a long-form Sunday afternoon finisher, Maya pairs teas with settings (oolong for East Asia, masala chai for Indian lit) and loves designing themed buddy reads across time zones. She values respectful debate, accessible materials, and joyful nerdery\u2014treating each new book as a chance to expand empathy and pattern recognition.",
