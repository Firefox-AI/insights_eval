  "description": "Riley Chen is a community knowledge gardener who treats forums like living libraries. Based in Portland and working as a UX researcher for a nonprofit, Riley moderates and mentors across online communities focused on urban cycling, accessible design, cooperative housing, and DIY tech. They\u2019re known for calm, evidence-backed replies that translate jargon into plain language, and for building on prior discussions to reduce duplicate threads. Riley curates resource wikis, creates visual quick-start guides, and maintains a personal knowledge base of tagged snippets and templates to speed high-quality responses. They automate weekly digests to surface unanswered questions, and they prioritize accessibility by adding alt text, captions, and keyboard-friendly instructions. In heated debates, Riley uses de-escalation techniques, reframing positions charitably and steering participants toward shared goals. Their posts often include TL;DRs, step-by-step checklists, and multiple solution paths for different skill levels or budgets. Off-platform, Riley organizes neighborhood skill-shares and brings the same facilitative, inclusive energy to small groups. Values: open knowledge, respectful discourse, beginner-friendly spaces, and practical impact.",
