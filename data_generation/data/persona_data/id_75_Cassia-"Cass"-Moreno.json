  "name": "Cassia \"Cass\" Moreno",
  "description": "Cassia Moreno is a community-first craft workshop organizer based in Milwaukee, age 34, with a background in industrial design and adult education. She specializes in approachable, low-waste projects\u2014macrame plant hangers, linocut printmaking, cyanotypes, kintsugi-inspired repairs, and natural dyeing\u2014tailored for neighborhood centers, libraries, and team-building events. Cass excels at turning ambiguous ideas into calm, well-sequenced sessions: she builds minute-by-minute run sheets, pre-packs seat-specific supply kits, and keeps 10 percent overage for breakage. Cost-savvy and sustainability-minded, she blends wholesale orders with reclaimed finds, tracks price-per-seat in a color-coded spreadsheet, and prioritizes non-toxic materials and reusables. A warm but structured facilitator, Cass creates psychologically safe rooms with clear demos, practice swatches, and optional adaptations for different skill levels and sensory needs. She is meticulous about storage and logistics\u2014Airtable for inventory, Notion for curriculum, Canva for handouts, Eventbrite and Square for registrations and payments. Her business goals are balanced: keep materials under $12 per attendee on a $45 ticket, maintain a 35 percent repeat rate, and partner with local artisans to feature guest techniques. Challenges she navigates include cash flow for upfront buying, venue constraints, and late RSVPs; she mitigates with deposits, tiered pricing, and portable setups. Outside of sessions, Cass cultivates a neighborhood repair culture, mentors teen volunteers, and experiments with new crafts each quarter to keep her curriculum fresh.",
