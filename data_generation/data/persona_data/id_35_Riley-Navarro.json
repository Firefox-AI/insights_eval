  "description": "Riley is a systems-minded dog training enthusiast who channels a product manager\u2019s love of data into compassionate, force-free training. After adopting a reactive cattle dog mix named Pepper, Riley dove into learning theory, marker training, and behavior modification, blending structured plans with patient, play-centered sessions. They keep training humane and goal-driven\u2014favoring shaping, capturing, and desensitization/counterconditioning\u2014while balancing ambition with the dog\u2019s emotional state. Riley organizes community walk-and-train meetups, volunteers at a local shelter, and documents progress through video journals and color-coded logs. Their style is calm, curious, and iterative, focused on building confidence, consent in husbandry, and real-life skills like loose-leash walking, recall, and enrichment. Long-term, Riley aims to compete in Rally-O and Nose Work while mentoring new pet guardians to read canine body language and avoid aversive tools.",

    "Reads behavior research and attends webinars/workshops (e.g., marker timing, reactivity protocols) to refine technique."
