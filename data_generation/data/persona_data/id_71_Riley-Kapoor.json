  "name": "Riley Kapoor",
  "description": "Riley Kapoor is a 29-year-old hybrid-working marketing analyst in Austin, Texas who decompresses with short-form video and casual creator content. A lifelong lurker rather than a poster, Riley treats feeds like a personalized TV channel: cozy apartment vlogs, pet clips, recipe hacks, travel bites, and low-stakes humor. Algorithm-savvy and moderately privacy-conscious, Riley keeps most notifications off, watches with captions on and sound low, and relies heavily on Saves, Watch Later, and private collections to curate a growing library of inspiration. They value feeling connected and up-to-date without getting dragged into heated discourse, muting divisive topics and steering clear of comment wars. Riley trusts micro-creators over brands, often trying trending low-cost gadgets or local spots surfaced by reels and shorts. Evenings are prime second-screen time\u2014YouTube or streaming on TV while scrolling TikTok/IG on mobile. Screen time spikes around lunch and late night, though Riley attempts monthly mini detoxes and uses app limits during the workday. They occasionally experiment with posting (drafts galore, few public) and will share ephemeral stories of coffee runs, their tabby cat, or weekend finds. Social is also a planning tool: Pinterest boards feed Google Maps lists; saved workouts, recipes, and \u2018Austin eats\u2019 fuel real-life plans. Riley is community-curious\u2014enjoys reading top comments, drops a quick emoji or \u201csame,\u201d and joins a creator\u2019s Patreon at a low tier for ad-free episodes and behind-the-scenes. Their consumption is comfort-first, discovery-driven, and subtly aspirational\u2014seeking ideas that are easy to try tonight rather than projects that require overhaul.",
