  "description": "Sana is a methodical, hype-resistant tech enthusiast who treats product launches like weather systems to be tracked, mapped, and compared. A UX researcher at a small accessibility-focused startup, she follows software and hardware news not just for novelty but to assess real-world impact\u2014especially for users with diverse abilities and bandwidth constraints. She maintains a personal \u201crelease radar\u201d pipeline that ingests RSS feeds, vendor roadmaps, changelogs, and developer forums, then tags items by maturity (rumor, preview, GA) and potential user benefit. Sana is analytical yet warm; she mentors friends on sensible upgrade cycles, keeps a running model of total cost of ownership, and prioritizes privacy and repairability. She keeps a tiny home lab to validate marketing claims\u2014benchmarking drivers, testing firmware, and noting gotchas in a shared Notion page. Outside work, Sana decompresses by building custom mechanical keyboards and biking to independent coffee shops, where she writes short, jargon-free explainers on what new releases actually mean. She measures her accuracy by logging predictions and postmortems, adjusts her sources accordingly, and loves turning chaos into comprehensible summaries.",
