  "name": "Maya Okafor",
  "description": "Maya is a 32-year-old community librarian and civic educator who specializes in translating complex legal rights and processes into clear, accessible guidance for neighbors and local organizations. A first\u2011generation college graduate with a background in information science, she\u2019s methodical, empathetic, and obsessed with primary sources. She\u2019s not a lawyer and is careful to distinguish information from advice, focusing on helping people understand procedures, deadlines, forms, and where to find authoritative resources. Maya\u2019s motivation comes from watching friends struggle with housing and employment issues; she believes that understanding due process and paperwork can be as empowering as money. She builds step-by-step checklists, color-codes statutes and agency rules, and uses plain-language analogies to demystify terms like jurisdiction, appeal, and administrative remedy. She collaborates with legal aid groups to verify accuracy, maintains a curated database of official links, and tracks local ordinances and pending bills. Calm under pressure, she listens first, maps a process flow, and offers options with pros/cons and next steps. Outside of work, she enjoys quiet mornings with court opinions and coffee, puzzle hunts, and organizing community teach-ins. Her long-term goal is to create a public, multilingual toolkit that helps renters, gig workers, and immigrants navigate common legal processes without feeling intimidated.",
