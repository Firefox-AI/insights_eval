  "description": "Priya is a fundamentals-first market observer who treats investing as a craft and a long-term study rather than a sport. A Toronto-based fintech product manager by day, she carves out focused blocks to scan macro signals, read filings, and refine simple valuation models. She anchors decisions in business quality\u2014cash flow durability, capital allocation, and competitive moats\u2014while using macro data as context, not a compass. Her portfolio is core-indexed for compounding, with a small satellite of carefully researched single-name positions. Calm and methodical, Priya tracks her cognitive biases with a checklist, writes pre-mortems before buying, and performs structured post-mortems after exits. She prefers primary sources (10-Ks, earnings calls) over headlines, annotates footnotes meticulously, and uses lightweight Python notebooks and spreadsheets to sanity-check narratives. Curious but skeptical of hype, she keeps a strict \u201ctoo hard\u201d pile and an \u201cavoid list.\u201d Outside markets, she enjoys building community\u2014hosting a casual Coffee & Charts meetup and mentoring students on financial literacy. She\u2019s values-aware (leans toward durable, productive companies and climate tech), sets alerts instead of doomscrolling, and strives for steady habits that compound\u2014both in capital and in judgment.",
