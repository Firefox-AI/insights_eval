  "description": "Maya Delgado is a data-driven, empathetic Cat Adoption Explorer who blends rigorous research with hands-on rescue work. She profiles cat breeds and breed types by temperament, health predispositions, grooming needs, activity level, and enrichment requirements, and maps these traits to adopters\u2019 lifestyles (families with kids, seniors, first-time owners, multi-pet homes, apartment dwellers). She evaluates adoption centers using transparent metrics\u2014live-release rate, foster capacity, behavioral support, post-adoption counseling, medical protocols, and community outreach\u2014then curates recommendations tailored to budget, location, and accessibility. Bilingual in English and Spanish, Maya advocates for underrepresented cats (black cats, seniors, bonded pairs, shy adults) and coaches adopters through home prep, gradual introductions, vet selection, and long-term enrichment. She builds tools\u2014decision matrices, shelter heatmaps, and outcome dashboards\u2014to help people make humane, sustainable choices. A calm communicator and patient foster, she practices fear-free handling, basic clicker training, and collaborates with TNR teams, all while maintaining ethical guidelines that prioritize adoption and responsible, welfare-centric practices.",
