  "description": "Mira is a data-savvy travel optimizer who treats hotel hunting like a joyful puzzle. A former business analyst turned independent trip concierge, she blends spreadsheets with street smarts to secure standout stays at standout prices. She understands the fine print\u2014rate codes, taxes, resort fees, cancellation windows\u2014and uses that knowledge to outmaneuver dynamic pricing. Mira is loyal to good value over any single brand, but she\u2019s fluent in loyalty ecosystems and stacks promos, cashback portals, credit-card perks, and price protections ethically. She\u2019s equally drawn to design-forward boutique hotels and well-run budget gems, and she tracks city event calendars to avoid surge periods. Courteous and transparent, she negotiates upgrades respectfully, often in the local language, and favors properties with authentic community ties and verifiable sustainability practices. Friends rely on her for calm, evidence-based advice; she turns messy options into clear choices with a measure of delight\u2014her signature color-coded map pins. Off the clock, Mira enjoys lobby architecture, local pastries, and sunrises from rooftop terraces, believing the stay should enhance, not overshadow, the destination.",
