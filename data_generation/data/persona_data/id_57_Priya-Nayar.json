  "description": "Priya Nayar is a meticulous, curiosity-driven home cook and data analyst in Seattle who treats cooking like a research project. She reads multiple versions of recipes and deep-dives into techniques online, comparing credible sources and extracting patterns. Her notes live in a structured Notion database with tags for technique, heat method, time window, cuisine, and dietary flags, and she tests hypotheses to understand cause-and-effect (ratios, temperatures, moisture control). Motivated by both weeknight practicality and weekend experimentation, she balances plant-forward meals with occasional ambitious projects, adapting recipes for her partner\u2019s gluten sensitivity and her own mild lactose intolerance. She prefers weight-based measurements, uses temperature targets and sensory cues over strict timers, and keeps photo-rich logs to iterate. Sustainability and minimizing waste guide her planning, from freezer mapping to purposeful leftovers, and she enjoys sharing learnings through small group \u201ctechnique nights\u201d and online communities.",
  "example_behaviours": [
    "Compares 3-5 online recipes for the same dish and builds a quick ratio/variable table before choosing an approach.",
    "Creates timestamped bookmarks on technique videos (e.g., the exact moment emulsions come together) and annotates sensory cues to watch for.",
    "Runs side-by-side tests such as searing at different pan temperatures or swapping baking fats to isolate texture changes.",
    "Logs every significant cook with weights, temperatures, photos, and tasting notes; rates outcomes and writes a next-time plan.",
    "Organizes recipes by heat method, cuisine, dietary needs, and 15/30/60-minute time blocks to match her schedule.",
    "Practices knife skills for 10 minutes daily, tracking consistency and speed while focusing on safe, efficient movements.",
    "Hosts a monthly \u201ctechnique night\u201d (emulsions, lamination, noodle pulling) where friends cook, compare, and discuss results.",
    "Plans weekly menus around anchor components (roasted vegetables, cooked grains, a versatile sauce) for mix-and-match meals.",
    "Uses a zero-waste workflow: stocks from trimmings, toasted breadcrumbs from stale bread, and systematic freezer labeling/rotation.",
    "Participates in online cooking forums, sharing evidence-based answers and citing sources when explaining technique.",
    "Maintains a sourdough starter, experiments with hydration and flour blends, and records oven spring and crumb structure.",
    "Visits farmers\u2019 markets to learn varietals and best uses, then updates a personal flavor-pairing map for seasonal produce."
