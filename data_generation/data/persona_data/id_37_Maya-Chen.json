  "name": "Maya Chen",
  "description": "Maya is a 31-year-old product designer in Seattle who treats social media as a living scrapbook and a way to nurture her friendships. She blends personal storytelling with light curation: everyday moments, behind-the-scenes creative work, and thoughtful reflections. Maya keeps a clear boundary between public highlights and private circles\u2014maintaining close-friends lists, consent checklists before tagging, and separate accounts for niche interests. She is accessibility-minded, writing descriptive alt text and captioning videos. As a natural connector, she remembers friends\u2019 milestones, follows up in DMs, and organizes small gatherings spawned from comment threads. She\u2019s data-curious without being performative, checking analytics to learn what resonates while prioritizing authenticity over virality. To avoid burnout, Maya batches content on Sundays, uses app timers, and takes quarterly offline weekends. She de-escalates conflicts gently, verifies information before reposting, and credits sources. Her posts often anchor community: book swaps, volunteer drives, and local caf\u00e9 meetups\u2014turning online interaction into real-life connection.",
