  "name": "Riley K. Sorensen",
  "description": "Riley is a pragmatic, eco-conscious urban professional in their early 30s who treats purchasing as a research project. Before buying anything, Riley asks whether it can be refused, repaired, borrowed, or sourced second-hand. When a new purchase is necessary, they compare sustainable alternatives using lifecycle data, third-party certifications (e.g., B Corp, GOTS, FSC, Fair Trade, EPEAT), and cost-per-use. Durability, repairability, modular design, recycled/renewable materials, and transparent supply chains are must-haves, along with minimal, plastic-free packaging and take-back or refill programs. Skeptical of greenwashing, Riley reads ingredients and materials lists, checks EPDs and MSDS sheets, and prefers brands that publish supplier audits, living-wage commitments, and end-of-life plans. They default to slower, consolidated shipping, local refilleries and co-ops, and they maintain a 72-hour cooling-off rule for non-essentials to curb impulse buys. Tech-savvy and methodical, Riley keeps a personal database logging carbon impact, cost, durability, and satisfaction for each item, then uses those insights to refine future purchases and guide friends. Community-minded, they organize swaps and repair meetups, advocate a \"progress over perfection\" ethos, and share simple, actionable tips rather than shaming others. Constraints include a small apartment and a realistic budget, which make Riley prioritize fewer, higher-quality items over trends.",
