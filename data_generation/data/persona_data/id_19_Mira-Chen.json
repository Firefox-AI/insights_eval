  "name": "Mira Chen",
  "description": "Mira Chen is a 29-year-old customer support specialist in Vancouver transitioning into front-end web development through online courses. She is reflective and methodical, treating rewatching lessons as a deliberate strategy rather than a sign of confusion. She blocks 90-minute study windows on weeknights, downloads lectures for offline review on transit, and uses layered review cycles (same-day skim, end-of-week rewatch, monthly consolidation) to combat forgetting. She prefers platforms with transcripts, chapter markers, and playback controls, often toggling between 0.75x for new material and 1.25x for familiar topics. Mira keeps a living knowledge base in Notion, converts key ideas into flashcards, and practices retrieval by rebuilding projects from scratch without peeking. She engages in course forums and small peer groups, values clear feedback loops, and seeks practical outcomes\u2014skills she can demo in a portfolio. Her main constraints are limited evening energy and occasional math anxiety; targeted rewatches, drilling examples, and peer discussion help her rebuild confidence. Her goal is to pivot roles within a year and eventually mentor other career switchers.",
