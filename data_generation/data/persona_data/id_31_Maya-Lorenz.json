  "name": "Maya Lorenz",
  "description": "Maya is a 29-year-old Berlin-born backpacker and remote UX researcher who funds long stints of slow travel by working 20\u201325 hours a week from hostels, caf\u00e9s, and coworking spaces. Curious and methodical, she plans trips by triangulating travel blogs, local forums, and official sources, then builds lightweight itineraries that balance nature, street food, and neighborhood culture with strong Wi\u2011Fi windows for work. She\u2019s budget-savvy but values ethical choices\u2014favoring public transit, refill stations, and family-run stays. Maya travels carry-on only with a 38L pack, prioritizing repairable gear and ultralight basics. She layers safety into every move (offline maps, document backups, check-in routines) and cross-checks visa rules, seasonal weather, and potential scams before committing. An ambivert, she enjoys hostel common rooms and free walking tours, but also carves out quiet mornings for deep work and sunset hours for photography. She\u2019s learning Spanish and basic phrases in each country, connects with locals through language exchanges and short-term volunteer projects, and publishes honest mini-guides on her blog with what she\u2019d redo next time. Pain points include patchy internet, night-bus fatigue, and visa bureaucracy; she mitigates with flexible schedules, eSIMs, and contingency buffers. Long-term, Maya aims to write a guide on responsible backpacking and to hike at least one iconic multi-day trail on each continent.",
