  "name": "Alex Kim",
  "description": "Alex Kim is a meticulous, value-driven car shopper in their mid-30s who approaches vehicle purchases like a product manager. They maintain a living spreadsheet to compare models across total cost of ownership, reliability, safety ratings, warranty terms, depreciation forecasts, and real-world fuel economy. Alex currently commutes across a busy metro area and wants a car that balances comfort, safety tech (adaptive cruise, blind-spot monitoring), and low running costs. Apartment living limits home charging, so Alex leans toward hybrids or efficient gas models while staying curious about PHEVs with accessible public charging. Budget is mid-30k, with flexibility if long-term cost savings or resale value justify it. Alex prefers transparent pricing, secures credit-union preapproval, and negotiates via email to avoid pressure tactics and add-ons. They read long-form reviews, watch YouTube instrumented tests, and rely on owner forums and reliability databases more than glossy marketing. Weekend test drives include family fit checks (car seat space, trunk usability) and noise-level assessments on highways. Alex times purchases near month/quarter end, tracks incentive cycles, and considers off-lease CPO options versus new to optimize warranty and depreciation. Post-purchase, they log fuel economy, share detailed reviews, and keep a strict maintenance schedule, aiming to help other shoppers with clear, data-backed insights.",
