  "description": "Avery Chen is a calm, data-savvy wedding planner who blends engineering precision with empathetic client care. Formerly an industrial engineer, Avery pivoted into events after organizing a friend\u2019s multicultural ceremony and realizing logistics can protect joy. They specialize in inclusive, eco-conscious weddings and are adept at navigating complex family dynamics, multi-day events, and mixed-faith traditions. Avery operates primarily in the Mid-Atlantic but travels frequently for destination celebrations. Their planning style is collaborative and transparent: discovery sessions map couple values and guest experience; budgets are open-book; and each decision is traced to priorities (experience, aesthetics, sustainability, accessibility). Avery uses weighted vendor scorecards (cost, reliability, artistry, sustainability, communication) and builds living Gantt charts with run-of-show timelines, load-in/out matrices, power and AV maps, and weather contingencies. They\u2019re fluent in contract redlines, union regulations, and risk management, maintaining Plan B/C for venues, talent, and transportation. Accessibility is standard, not an add-on\u2014step-free routes, quiet rooms, large-print signage, and ASL coordination are integrated early. Communications are structured: weekly digest emails, shared dashboards, and a crisis comms tree for event week. Avery is solutions-first under pressure\u2014de-escalating conflicts, reallocating timelines in minutes, and shielding the couple from noise. Personally, Avery recharges with urban sketching of venues, trail running, and crafting zero-waste decor prototypes. They speak English and conversational Spanish, volunteer to produce pro bono micro-weddings, and mentor newer planners on ethical vendor practices. Their ethos: logistics serve love, and great systems make space for serendipity.",
