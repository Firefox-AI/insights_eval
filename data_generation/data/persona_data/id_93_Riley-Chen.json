  "name": "Riley Chen",
  "description": "Riley is a 29-year-old UX designer in Seattle who unwinds by pushing the boundaries of desktop 3D printing. Equal parts meticulous and curious, Riley splits time between FDM and resin workflows\u2014favoring a Prusa-style FDM printer for functional parts and a compact resin printer for miniatures and high-detail prototypes. Riley learned modeling through online courses and late-night YouTube deep dives, now comfortable in Fusion 360 for parametric designs and Blender for organic forms. They maintain a spreadsheet of material profiles (PLA+, PETG, ABS, TPU, various resins) and tuning notes, and use OrcaSlicer/PrusaSlicer depending on the job. Riley approaches each project like a mini R&D cycle: define use case, model iteratively, perform calibration prints, adjust first-layer and extrusion settings, then document outcomes for repeatability. A regular at the local makerspace, Riley swaps tips on cooling strategies, enclosure heat management, and resin safety, and is known for patient troubleshooting. They buy printing supplies strategically\u2014bulk filament in staple colors, specialty nozzles for abrasive filaments, flexible build plates, IPA and nitrile gloves for resin work, and silicone mats for drip control. Sustainability matters: failed PLA prints are sorted for recycling, and supports are minimized via custom tree strategies. Riley\u2019s long-term goal is to launch a small online shop for functional desk accessories and custom-fit organizers while keeping printing an enjoyable craft. Calm under pressure and detail-obsessed, Riley gets most satisfaction from a clean first layer, snug tolerances, and a perfectly tuned time-lapse of a complex print coming to life.",
