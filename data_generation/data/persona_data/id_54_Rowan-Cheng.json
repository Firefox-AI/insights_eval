  "name": "Rowan Cheng",
  "description": "Rowan Cheng is a 34-year-old data analyst based in Denver who treats outdoor gear purchases like mini research projects. A year-round backpacker, weekend splitboarder, and shoulder-season bikepacker, Rowan balances ultralight aspirations with durability and repairability. He builds comparison matrices before buying anything, weighing grams-per-dollar, warranty length, repair options, materials (e.g., Dyneema vs. silnylon), and sustainability claims. He prefers modular systems (layering, quilt + pad combos, stove kits) and buys big-ticket items once and well, while hunting outlet deals for apparel. Rowan follows cottage-industry makers, reads spec sheets and EN/ISO ratings, and cross-checks crowd feedback in forums and field tests. He is prone to analysis paralysis, so he sets decision deadlines and uses price alerts to time purchases. A mild knee issue makes trekking poles and ergonomic pack suspension non-negotiable. He repairs gear (Tenacious Tape, patch kits, seam sealing) and sells or trades unused items on gear marketplaces to keep a tight, seasonally rotated closet. Rowan leads local hike meetups, writes succinct gear mini-reviews, and runs backcountry routes with an eye on avalanche reports and weather models. He values brands with transparent sustainability practices, favors robust return policies and part-availability, and keeps a log of real-world performance after each trip to refine his kit.",
