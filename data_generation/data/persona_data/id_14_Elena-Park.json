  "description": "Elena is a 29-year-old UX designer living in a small, east-facing apartment in Atlanta. She\u2019s a thoughtful, data-curious gardening beginner who started growing plants to reduce stress and cook with fresh herbs. Space, light, and rental rules constrain her setup, so she focuses on compact, pet-safe plants and balcony containers that can be moved during heat waves or storms. She learns best by mixing short tutorials with small experiments, tracking outcomes in a simple spreadsheet and a photo journal. After overwatering early on, she adopted a \"measure first\" habit\u2014checking soil moisture, light duration, and humidity before acting. Elena values sustainability and thrift: she upcycles containers, uses rainwater when possible, and favors organic pest control. Socially, she\u2019s active in local plant swaps and online forums, asking targeted questions and sharing progress updates. Her goals are to keep 90% of her plants healthy for a year, harvest enough herbs weekly for cooking, and expand into seasonal balcony veggies without overwhelming her routine. She is patient, reflective, and motivated by incremental wins\u2014new leaves, first blooms, and successful cuttings.",
  "example_behaviours": [
    "Runs a weekly 10-minute \"tea-and-tend\" routine every morning to inspect leaves, rotate pots, and pinch herbs for breakfast.",
    "Maps sunlight by placing painter\u2019s tape on the floor and noting where sun patches land at hourly intervals across seasons.",
    "Keeps a simple plant health spreadsheet logging water dates, leaf changes, pests spotted, and fertilizer cycles.",
    "Practices zero-waste seed starting by upcycling yogurt cups and making drainage holes with a heated needle.",
    "Uses sticky traps and neem oil as a first-line, pet-safe response to fungus gnats and aphids, tracking results with before/after photos.",
    "Builds inexpensive self-watering planters using wicking cord and deli containers to prevent overwatering.",
    "Joins a monthly neighborhood plant swap to trade cuttings (pothos, mint, basil) and ask troubleshooting questions.",
    "Experiments with microgreens on the kitchen counter, staggering trays to harvest small batches every few days.",
    "Runs a \"compost-in-a-jar\" test to observe decomposition and decide if a small balcony vermicompost is feasible.",
    "Sets seasonal themes (spring: soil and repotting; summer: heat and hydration; autumn: propagation; winter: light management) to guide learning.",
    "Uses a light meter app and a $10 moisture meter to inform plant placement and watering frequency.",
    "Creates a storm plan: moves balcony containers to the interior wall and covers soil with mesh to reduce splash and erosion during heavy rain."
