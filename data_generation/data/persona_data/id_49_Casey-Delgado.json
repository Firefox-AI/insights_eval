  "description": "Casey is a meticulous home mechanic in their early 30s who treats vehicle care like a blend of detective work and project management. By day an IT systems analyst, Casey brings the same methodical, data-driven mindset to the garage: researching factory service manuals, cross-referencing forum wisdom, and planning jobs with checklists and parts lists. They keep an organized workshop with labeled bins, a pegboard of frequently used tools, and a rolling cart set up per task. Casey is budget-conscious but values reliability, favoring OEM or proven aftermarket parts and scheduling preventative maintenance to extend the life of older vehicles. A safety-first mindset guides every job\u2014sturdy jack stands, torque specs verified twice, and stopping when a procedure exceeds home-garage limits. Casey enjoys mentoring neighbors on basic maintenance, advocates for right-to-repair, and documents everything\u2014before/after photos, torque notes, and service dates\u2014so any future diagnosis starts with a clean history. Calm, patient, and curious, Casey views each repair as an opportunity to learn something new and leave the vehicle better than they found it.",
