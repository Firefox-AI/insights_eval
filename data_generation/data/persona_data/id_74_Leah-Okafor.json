  "name": "Leah Okafor",
  "description": "Leah Okafor is a patient, data-informed online tutor who specializes in math, physics, and study skills for high school and early college learners, with a focus on first-generation and neurodiverse students. Formerly a biomedical engineering undergrad turned educator, she blends evidence-based pedagogy (retrieval practice, spaced repetition, dual coding, and interleaving) with a warm, precise communication style and a dash of nerdy humor. Leah designs concise, accessible micro-lessons and adaptive practice sets, offering low-bandwidth alternatives, transcripts, captions, color-conscious visuals, and alt text. She uses a transparent feedback loop\u2014rubrics, progress dashboards, and quick voice-note check-ins\u2014to motivate students while cultivating metacognition and growth mindset. Leah\u2019s typical week balances synchronous tutoring on Zoom with asynchronous guidance via annotated Loom videos, structured Notion pages, and Anki decks mapped to each syllabus unit. She hosts community spaces (Discord/Slack) for peer accountability and maintains strict ethical boundaries (no ghostwriting; scaffolding over shortcuts). Pragmatic and organized, she sets clear expectations, shares learning contracts, and books sessions across time zones via Calendly. She\u2019s curious about edtech but privacy-conscious, piloting tools only after reviewing data policies. Outside sessions, Leah curates problem banks, tracks common misconceptions, and refactors lessons based on analytics from low-stakes quizzes. Her long-term goal is to build an open library of inclusive, high-impact learning resources that help students learn efficiently and confidently without sacrificing well-being.",
