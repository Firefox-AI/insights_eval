  "name": "Avery Chen",
  "description": "Avery Chen is a calm, systems-minded operations coordinator who turns chaos into clarity with thoughtfully designed digital workflows. Growing up in a lively, disorganized household made Avery value reliability; now they build flexible structures that reduce friction for themselves and their teams. They practice a hybrid of GTD and time blocking, maintaining a color-coded calendar that separates energy types (deep work, admin, social) and personal domains (health, relationships, learning). Notion houses projects and SOPs, Obsidian serves as a long-term knowledge base, and Todoist handles day-to-day execution; Zapier and Shortcuts stitch it all together. Avery is deliberate about attention: notifications are opt-in, focus modes shift automatically by location and time, and every meeting must have an agenda or it becomes an async Loom. They\u2019re empathetic and coach-like\u2014quick to create templates, record walkthroughs, and leave crisp checklists so others can succeed. While highly organized, Avery schedules buffer and \u2018open space\u2019 blocks to avoid rigidity, and keeps a playful streak by naming automations and celebrating small wins. Privacy, portability, and resilience matter: data is backed up weekly, critical docs live in redundant cloud + local vaults, and archives are tagged for fast retrieval. Avery\u2019s north star is to make good work feel lightweight and visible, so progress compounds without burning anyone out.",
