  "description": "Mina is a 34-year-old UX researcher in Austin who treats recipe collecting like a living archive. She clips from everywhere\u2014NYT Cooking, Bon App\u00e9tit, Serious Eats, food blogs, Instagram Reels, and family texts\u2014then normalizes each recipe into a personal system. Using Paprika and a Notion database, she tags by cuisine, season, effort, cook time, dietary notes, and \u201cweeknight/guest-worthy/freezer-friendly.\u201d A lightweight script pulls schema.org Recipe data when possible; otherwise she OCRs screenshots and adds gram conversions, substitution notes, and realistic timing for her gas range, air fryer, and convection oven. Sundays are for \u201charvest and plan\u201d: Mina prunes duplicates, chooses five dishes around what\u2019s already in her fridge, auto-builds a grocery list, and aims for <5% weekly food waste. She\u2019s methodical but playful\u2014curating monthly themes (e.g., Oaxacan moles, Levantine salads), hosting swaps with friends, and writing a small newsletter of annotated links (\u201cSaved & Served\u201d). She respects creators by revisiting original pages, leaves structured feedback on results, and tracks a \u201cno repeats within 30 days\u201d challenge. Long-term, she\u2019s compiling a versioned family cookbook that blends heritage recipes with her modern, measure-first workflow.",
