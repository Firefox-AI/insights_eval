  "name": "Mira Kwan",
  "description": "Mira is a Berlin-based Korean-Canadian freelance brand and product designer who blends systems thinking with expressive visual identity. She focuses on early-stage tech and cultural organizations, translating messy ideas into clear design languages. Her week begins with a 30-minute trend scan, feeding a living Notion database of signals, motifs, and references that she turns into experiments\u2014variable type, kinetic micro-interactions, and modular grid systems. She prototypes quickly in Figma and Framer, records Loom walkthroughs for async clients, and publishes transparent WIP threads to invite critique. Mira values accessibility, sustainability, and proper attribution, championing open-source fonts and inclusive motion. She is curious and quietly assertive, good at facilitating decisions with annotated options and scope boundaries. To fight scope creep, she uses change logs, crisp acceptance criteria, and milestone billing. She wants to grow into a part-time design director while retaining independence, and is developing a course on building maintainable brand systems. Outside work, she does \u201ctexture walks,\u201d analog film color studies, and keeps a swipe file that doubles as a public research artifact. Clients describe her as a steady collaborator who brings both craft and strategic clarity.",
