  "name": "Maya Chen",
  "description": "Maya is a 29-year-old product analyst in Austin who treats her activewear closet like a well-run project. She trains five days a week\u2014morning runs, two strength sessions, a weekend yoga class, and the occasional bouldering session\u2014so she seeks apparel that balances performance, durability, and price. Pragmatic and data-driven, Maya compares fabrics (nylon vs. polyester blends, GSM, and elastane percentages), construction details (flatlock seams, gussets, bonded hems), and real-user photo reviews before purchasing. She\u2019s budget-conscious but strategic: invests in high-wear staples and hunts discounts for trend pieces. Fit consistency, compression level, squat-proof opacity, pocket depth, breathability, and waistband stability are her top criteria. Digitally savvy, she stacks loyalty points and cashback, sets price alerts, and maintains a gear log with cost-per-wear and wash outcomes. She prefers brands with transparent sustainability claims, inclusive sizing (including petite lengths), robust return policies, and community programming. Her pain points are inconsistent sizing across collections, greenwashing, pilling after a few washes, and shallow or missing pockets. She aims to maintain a versatile capsule wardrobe in muted tones with a few seasonal accents, reduce decision fatigue, and keep purchases intentional while training for her next half marathon.",
