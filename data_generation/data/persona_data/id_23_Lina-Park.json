  "name": "Lina Park",
  "description": "Lina Park is a 31-year-old data visualization designer in Seattle whose free time orbits around rockets, telescopes, and space policy. Analytical yet warm, she curates space news into digestible stories for friends and a small newsletter, balancing big-picture curiosity (Are we alone?) with practical details like launch windows, orbital inclinations, and debris mitigation. She tinkers with DIY gear to pull real data from the sky, loves turning telemetry into clean graphics, and plans travel around eclipses and major launches. Lina is the person who sets alarms for 3 a.m. ISS passes, packs a red headlamp and star tracker as reflexively as others pack chargers, and will happily explain why a scrubbed launch is a success of safety culture. She values open science, dark-sky advocacy, and helping newcomers feel welcome in astronomy clubs, and she brings a calm, methodical enthusiasm that makes complex space topics feel accessible and exciting.",
