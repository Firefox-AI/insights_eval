  "name": "Maya Kapoor",
  "description": "Maya is a 31-year-old product manager in a fintech startup who treats tech purchases like mini research projects. She\u2019s an early-but-pragmatic adopter who balances cutting-edge features with total cost of ownership. Before buying, she builds comparison matrices of specs, software support timelines, repairability scores, and historical pricing. She tracks deals across multiple retailers, waits for seasonal sale cycles, and leverages price protection and cashback cards. Privacy and longevity matter to her: she prefers brands with transparent update policies, minimal bloat, and good right-to-repair practices, and she\u2019s comfortable flashing firmware or debloating when needed. Maya runs a tidy, interoperable setup across ecosystems\u2014Android phone with a Pixel, MacBook for work, Linux on a mini PC at home\u2014and uses open-source tools when practical. She runs Home Assistant to keep smart-home gear local-first, resells or donates old devices responsibly, and keeps meticulous records of warranties and return windows. Friends rely on her for practical advice because she explains trade-offs clearly\u2014battery vs. brightness, camera pipeline vs. raw sensor size, subscription lock-in vs. one-time cost. She follows reviewers who test methodically, and she distrusts hype without data. Her buying philosophy: best value for her use, not the lowest sticker price.",
