  "name": "Maya Tran",
  "description": "Maya Tran is a 33-year-old UX designer who unwinds on weekends by transforming her small apartment kitchen into a meticulous pastry lab. She\u2019s self-taught with a scientist\u2019s mindset: every bake is an experiment, every variable noted. Maya gravitates toward laminated doughs, fruit-forward tarts, and choux, weaving in Asian flavors like black sesame, yuzu, and matcha. She sources eggs and butter from local farms, plans menus around the Saturday market, and keeps sustainability in mind by minimizing food waste and repurposing trimmings into creative snacks. Her week is structured so that Friday nights are for prep and mise en place; Saturdays become long, meditative sessions of lamination, proofing, and testing; Sundays are for glazing, photography in natural light, and porch pickups for neighbors who pre-order via a simple online form. Maya maintains a living recipe database with notes, photos, and A/B test results, and she enjoys teaching others\u2014hosting small, hands-on sessions for friends and neighborhood kids. Though her oven runs a bit hot and counter space is scarce, she compensates with precision tools, tight scheduling, and clever storage. She\u2019s generous with failures as well as wins, posting honest breakdowns so others can learn from her process, and she donates part of her bake sale proceeds to local mutual-aid efforts.",
