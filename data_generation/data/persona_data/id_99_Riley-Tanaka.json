  "name": "Riley Tanaka",
  "description": "Riley Tanaka is an experienced online community moderator in their early 30s who blends sociological insight with systems thinking to shape healthy, resilient digital spaces. Calm under pressure and precise in language, Riley uses a trauma-informed, curiosity-first approach to de-escalation, aiming to preserve dignity while enforcing clear, well-documented rules. They manage a diverse portfolio of communities across education, indie gaming, and productivity, coordinating volunteer mods across time zones and maintaining playbooks for everything from first-time infractions to crisis response. Riley is data-literate and tool-agnostic, using dashboards to detect sentiment shifts, automating repetitive tasks with lightweight scripts, and running small A/B experiments to tune policies (e.g., slow-mode thresholds or onboarding prompts). Their moderation philosophy prioritizes transparency, restorative conversation, and proportional consequences: warn, coach, time-limit, then remove\u2014with an accessible appeals path and clear rationale notes. They partner with product and trust & safety to refine guidelines, run quarterly policy audits, and design inclusive onboarding rituals that set tone from day one. Accessibility and psychological safety are central to Riley\u2019s practice: they write in plain language, add alt text, offer bilingual summaries (English/Spanish), and maintain a phrasebook of empathetic responses to reduce cognitive load during heated threads. Outside work hours, Riley invests in moderator well-being through after-action reviews and rotating on-call windows to prevent burnout. They\u2019re known for turning abstract community values into concrete habits, like welcome threads, role-specific flair, and recurring member showcases that amplify positive norms.",
