  "name": "Maya Ortega",
  "description": "Maya Ortega is a 34-year-old public library programs coordinator in Madison, Wisconsin, who treats staying on top of local news, policy updates, and community events as both a civic duty and a practical tool for her job. Each morning she triages city press releases, local outlets, school board notes, transit alerts, and neighborhood forums, logging items into a Notion database tagged by topic and urgency. Bilingual in English and Spanish, she summarizes key policy changes in plain language and translates important notices for Spanish-speaking patrons and neighbors. Nonpartisan and solutions-focused, she avoids hot takes, prioritizes verified sources, and tracks how decisions on zoning, public safety, budgets, and transit affect everyday residents and library programming. Outside work, she volunteers with her neighborhood association, maintains a shared community calendar, and organizes low-cost events that bridge groups. She prefers walking and biking, photographs evolving storefronts for a personal archive, and uses urban sketching and baking as quiet counterweights to her outward-facing routine.",
