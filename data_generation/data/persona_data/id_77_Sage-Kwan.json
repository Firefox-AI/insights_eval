  "name": "Sage Kwan",
  "description": "Sage Kwan is a 31-year-old remote product designer living in a 420 sq ft studio, who treats minimalism like a design research project. Calm, methodical, and systems-oriented, Sage blends decluttering strategies with small-space interior experiments to create a home that\u2019s both restful and high-functioning. They iterate layouts with floor-plan sketches, track possessions in a digital inventory, and test routines (like one-in-one-out and 30-day quarantines) to ensure every item earns its keep. Aesthetically, Sage favors warm neutrals, natural textures, and a Japandi influence, balancing negative space with a few intentional focal points. Sustainability and ethics guide purchasing: buy secondhand first, buy fewer but better, repair before replace. Socially, Sage is generous\u2014hosting low-clutter gatherings, lending tools via local Buy Nothing groups, and sharing before/after insights that demystify minimalism without moralizing. Friction points include sentimental keepsakes and a partner\u2019s music gear; Sage responds by defining zones, adding beautiful storage, and practicing \u2018document-before-donate\u2019 rituals. They view minimalism not as austerity, but as intentionality that supports creative work, mental clarity, and time for people and projects that matter.",
