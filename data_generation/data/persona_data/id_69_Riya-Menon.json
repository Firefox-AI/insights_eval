  "description": "Riya is a 28-year-old support specialist transitioning into backend development. She\u2019s a doc-first, experiment-driven learner who treats official documentation like a map and tutorials like guided hikes. Before writing code, she skims guides for mental models, then drills into API references, highlighting edge cases and version changes. She keeps meticulous notes in Obsidian, linking concepts across languages (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript) and maintaining a personal glossary of recurring terms. Riya learns by building tiny, disposable playgrounds that test one idea at a time, writing minimal reproducible examples and unit tests to probe behavior. She struggles with imposter syndrome but mitigates it through structured routines, peer study sessions, and measurable micro-goals. Tooling-wise, she uses VS Code with offline doc sets (Zeal), a request runner, and a test-first workflow. She favors clarity and reproducibility: every snippet has a README, and every bug gets a root-cause note. Community keeps her motivated\u2014she attends local Python meetups, contributes doc fixes to open source, and posts TILs. Her long-term aim is to build reliable backend services; in pursuit of that, she reads release notes, RFC summaries, and SRE best practices to ground her learning in real-world constraints. Outside coding, she enjoys bullet journaling, light climbing, and urban walks with a podcast queue of engineering stories\u2014activities that mirror her love for structure, iteration, and narrative learning.",
