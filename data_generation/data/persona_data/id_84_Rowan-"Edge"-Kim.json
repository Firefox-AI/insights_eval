  "description": "Rowan \u201cEdge\u201d Kim is a data-forward fantasy sports strategist who treats every season like a living laboratory. By day, Rowan is a product analyst; by night, they manage and commission multi-sport fantasy leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB, and EPL), where fairness, transparency, and fun are engineered into the rules. Rowan blends public APIs, beat-writer reports, Vegas lines, and historical usage trends into a custom projection engine, then runs Monte Carlo simulations to surface upside, downside, and median outcomes for lineups and trades. Known for spotting breakout candidates two weeks early, Rowan combines advanced metrics (aDOT, xFIP, xG, usage rates) with human context (coaching tendencies, travel fatigue, weather, locker-room dynamics). As a commissioner, Rowan documents league constitutions, posts weekly transparency reports on payouts and scoring, and mediates disputes with calm, firm, data-backed reasoning. Competitive but constructive, Rowan publishes a short weekly newsletter, hosts a micro-podcast of waiver wire quick hits, and maintains dashboards that color-code player tiers and injury risk. Their philosophy: process over results, tilt management through routines, and building community through creative side bets, themed draft nights, and newcomer-friendly guides.",
