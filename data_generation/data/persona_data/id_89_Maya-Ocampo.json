  "name": "Maya Ocampo",
  "description": "Maya is a bilingual (English/Spanish) community connector in her early 30s who turns scattered civic opportunities into clear, welcoming on-ramps for busy neighbors. By day she\u2019s a UX designer; after hours she curates a citywide volunteer digest, translating nonprofit needs into bite-size actions, accessible posts, and mobile-friendly sign-ups. She maps where help is needed most, builds relationships with organizers, and pilots small experiments\u2014like micro-commitment shifts and buddy systems\u2014to reduce no-shows and first-time volunteer anxiety. Data-savvy but people-first, Maya uses lightweight tools (Airtable, Google Calendar, WhatsApp groups) to surface reliable events, track impact stories, and ensure language-accessible, ADA-aware information. She thrives on approachable, low-ego leadership: open coffee hours, quick voice notes, and honest post-mortems. Rooted in reciprocity, she insists that volunteering should strengthen both the community and the volunteers\u2014adding skill-building, reflection, and celebration. Calm under pressure and trained in conflict de-escalation, Maya mediates between passionate stakeholders, keeps scope realistic, and safeguards against burnout with opt-in roles and clear boundaries. Her north star is making civic participation feel as normal and delightful as a weekend plan with friends.",
