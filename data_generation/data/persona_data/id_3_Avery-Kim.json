  "name": "Avery Kim",
  "description": "Avery Kim is an early-30s UX researcher who converted a small den into a space-efficient micro-gym with adjustable dumbbells, kettlebells, a foldable rack, a suspension trainer, and smart lighting. Methodical and data-minded, Avery follows 12-week periodized programs that balance strength, mobility, and conditioning. Sessions are calendar-blocked before work, and intensity is adjusted using sleep, HRV, and heart-rate data from a smartwatch and ring. Shopping is pragmatic and sustainable: Avery compares reviews, checks material specs and footprint, waits for sales, and buys secondhand when sensible. Prefers minimalist, durable gear and eco-friendly fabrics. Learns through coaching apps and YouTube form breakdowns, tracking progress in Notion with color-coded tags. Social motivation is low-key\u2014monthly progress summaries are shared with a small friends chat and occasional virtual group workouts. Nutrition is plant-forward and high-protein with weekly meal prep; caffeine is timed before high-intensity days. Avery values good form and recovery (mobility, foam rolling, deload weeks) and aims to master strict pull-ups and pistol squats while keeping workouts enjoyable and efficient.",
